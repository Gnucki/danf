Danf Concepts
=============

[←](../index.md)

Just take 10 minutes to understand some of the main concepts that lead the development of Danf.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
---------------------------------

This part is going to be short. OOP is a way to develop big and complex applications for a long time now. Most commonly used languages are designed for that. Theoretical and empirical ways of coding with OOP are mature and allow to structure and develop robust applications.

However, native javascript does not provide all features you need to make a powerful OOP code. Danf implements an OOP layer allowing to handle that problematic.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
-----------------------------------

SOA is often thought at a webservice level but is also the base of a strong factored OOP code.

Let's see an example of a pure OOP code where you want to sell a product in a store to a customer:

```javascript
var store = new Store(),
    product = new Product(),
    customer = new Customer()
;

// A first possibility.
store.sell(product, customer);

// A second possibility.
product.buy(store, customer);

// ...
```

This almost automatically leads to have duplicated codes very hard to maintain:
* You have to test each code.
* If one code evolves, you must not forget the other one.

Of course, you can try to only have one implemented method. But where? In `Product`? `Store`? `Customer`? And how to be sure it is implemented only once?

A better way, to design that is to use a "service" (SOA pattern):

```javascript
var store = new Store(),
    product = new Product(),
    customer = new Customer(),
    saleHandler = new SaleHandler()
;

saleHandler.sell(product, store, customer);
```

The handler `saleHandler` is a service which is responsible for sales. He has the intelligence to manipulate data objects like `store`, `product` or `customer`.
This way, your code is factored and your developement is rationalized.

Composition and low coupling
----------------------------

### Composition vs inheritance

Lots of developers use inheritance to factorize code between classes. Of course it is not a bad idea, but it should be used in a strict delimited way. Multiple inheritance has many problems (diamond, complexity, ...) which often lead to a code difficult to maintain. In Danf, single inheritance is the rule. The framework encourages to use inheritance only when the parent and the child class have the same responsability.

Let's keep the previous example. Imagine, there are 3 sale entities in the company (clothing, perfume, jewel). This results in 3 `SaleHandler` child classes defining a method `getAfterSalesServicePhone()`. Child classes are sale handlers as their parent, so inheritance is fine. Now, imagine we want to log sales. Is it a good idea to make an abtract loggable class and make our child classes inherit from it? The response is obviously no! The way to handle it is simple:

```javascript
var clothingSaleHandler = new ClothingSaleHandler(),
    perfumeSaleHandler = new PerfumeSaleHandler(),
    jewelSaleHandler = new JewelSaleHandler(),
    logger = new Logger()
;

clothingSaleHandler.setLogger(logger);
perfumeSaleHandler.setLogger(logger);
jewelSaleHandler.setLogger(logger);
```

The responsability of a sale handler is not to log or be loggable but to handle sales. This is why composition must be used instead of inheritance. Here, the logging factored code is in the class `Logger`.

### Low coupling

Coupling is the degree of interaction between two classes. In an inheritance relation, the coupling is maximum: the child is fully dependent on its parent. This kind of coupling is really hard to change. In a simple composition relation, the coupling is the same as in an inheritance. However, it is possible to reduce this dependency by defining interfaces between classes.

Imagine, `Logger` has 30 methods. Sale handlers only need to call method `log()`. Then, a sale handler only need an object from a class implementing the interface `LoggerInterface` defining `log()`.

You can easily see the resulting benefits:
- Scalability: you can change the class `Logger` by another one implementing `LoggerInterface`.
- Maintenability: you can understand real dependencies between classes at a glance.
- Testability: you can mock dependencies just implementing the interfaces.

Danf allows to define and ensure interfaces to reduce coupling. This concept is important because it is the basis for using the dependency injection to its full potential and dependency injection is the basis for a strong OOP architecture.

Inversion of Control (IoC)
--------------------------

Danf handle the flow of control of your application for you. All you have to do is implement your classes and use the configuration to describe all the interactions.

A strong dependency injection component allows you to declare services from your classes and then inject them into each others. If you are coming from the PHP community, you will notice some similarity with the dependency injection of Symfony2.

Isomorphism
-----------

One of the big interests of Node.js is that you can use the same langage (javascript) on both client and server sides. But the ways of coding in Node.js and for a webpage is often so different that this asset is not operated at 100%. Danf is an isomorphic framework which propose you to potentially and easily use the same code on both sides with a classic Node.js coding style.

Pattern Event/Sequencing/Model
------------------------------

This framework does not forget the spirit of javascript and node.js: events drive the flow. In Danf, you will be able to handle all incoming events the same way. For instance, a HTTP request event will be handled as a click on an element in the browser. This give a pretty easy global architecture for your workflows:

- Event: an event is triggered (DOM event, HTTP request, socket message, command, ...)
- Sequencing: a list of sequences is processed allowing to easily control parallel and series executions of synchronous and asynchronous operations
    * a sequence is a list of operations and sub-sequences
    * an operation is a call to a method of a service
    * a service is an instantiation of a class with some dependencies injected
- Model: implementations are separated from the sequencing and injection logic allowing to have a real dynamic and scalable architecture
    * a dynamic injection is available thanks to configuration of services
    * interfaces can be defined with some configuration to ensure contract between classes and enable a real low coupling
